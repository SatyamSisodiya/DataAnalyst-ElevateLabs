Titanic Dataset EDA Observations

1. Dataset Overview:
- Total passengers: 891
- 12 variables including passenger ID, survival status, class, name, sex, age, etc.
- Missing values present in Age (177 missing) and Cabin (687 missing)

2. Basic Statistics:
- Overall survival rate: ~38% of passengers survived
- Gender distribution: More male passengers (577) than female passengers (314)
- Passenger class distribution: Majority in 3rd class (491), followed by 1st class (216) and 2nd class (184)
- Most passengers embarked from Southampton (S)

3. Correlation Analysis:
- Strong positive correlation between Fare and Pclass (higher class = higher fare)
- Moderate positive correlation between Survival and Sex (being female increased survival chances)
- Weak positive correlation between Survival and Fare
- Weak negative correlation between Survival and Pclass (lower class = lower survival rate)

4. Age Distribution:
- Mean age: approximately 30 years
- Most passengers were between 20-40 years old
- Age distribution is slightly right-skewed
- Survival rates varied across age groups, with children having higher survival rates

5. Survival Analysis:
a) By Class:
- 1st class had highest survival rate (~63%)
- 2nd class had moderate survival rate (~47%)
- 3rd class had lowest survival rate (~24%)

b) By Gender:
- Females had much higher survival rate (~74%)
- Males had very low survival rate (~19%)

c) By Embarkation Port:
- Passengers from Cherbourg (C) had highest survival rate
- Southampton (S) and Queenstown (Q) had lower survival rates

d) By Fare:
- Survivors generally paid higher fares
- Clear correlation between fare amount and survival probability

6. Advanced EDA:
a) Family Size:
- Passengers with small family sizes (2-4 members) had higher survival rates.
- Solo travelers (FamilySize = 1) and those with very large families (FamilySize > 4) had lower survival rates.

b) Title Analysis:
- Titles such as 'Miss', 'Mrs', and 'Master' had higher survival rates, indicating gender and age played a role.
- Titles like 'Mr' had significantly lower survival rates.
- Rare titles (e.g., 'Dr', 'Rev') had varied survival outcomes, likely due to small sample sizes.

c) Fare Distribution by Embarkation Port:
- Passengers embarking from Cherbourg (C) paid higher fares on average.
- Southampton (S) had a wider range of fares, with many passengers paying lower fares.
- Queenstown (Q) passengers generally paid the lowest fares.

d) Age vs Fare Interaction:
- Survivors generally paid higher fares, regardless of age.
- Younger passengers (children) who survived often paid lower fares.
- Non-survivors were more evenly distributed across age and fare ranges.

Key Findings:
1. Being female was the strongest predictor of survival
2. Higher class passengers (1st class) had better survival rates
3. Children had better survival chances than adults
4. Passengers who paid higher fares had better survival rates
5. Embarkation port had some influence on survival probability

These findings suggest that social class, gender, and age played significant roles in survival probability during the Titanic disaster, with women and higher-class passengers having significantly better chances of survival.
